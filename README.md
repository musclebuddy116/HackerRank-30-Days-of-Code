# Hacker Rank 30 Days of Code
This contains my solutions for HackerRank's 30 Days of Code challenge. I am using this challenge to keep my coding skills sharp and to code consistently.

There is a folder for each day of the challenge. Inside the folder is a 'description.txt' file with the challenge and any other details provided, and at least one solution file.
